# Compound Interest Calculator

This project is a simple **Compound Interest Calculator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to enter their initial investment, monthly contribution, number of years, and annual interest rate, then calculates:

- The **regular (uncompounded)** total
- The **final compounded** total
- The **difference** between the two values

---

## 🧮 How It Works

The calculator uses a basic compound interest formula that compounds annually.  
Each year, it adds the total yearly contributions to the balance and then applies the interest rate.
